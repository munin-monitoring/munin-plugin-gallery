The `master` branch of the [Munin repository](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin) is
used for the development of the upcoming Munin 3.x.

* browse the branch: https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin/tree/master
* clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin.git`

Please note, that you may want to contribute changes to [Munin (2.0)](/repositories/munin-2.0)
instead, if these changes are also suitable for the current stable release of Munin.
The `stable-2.0` branch is periodically merged into `master`.
