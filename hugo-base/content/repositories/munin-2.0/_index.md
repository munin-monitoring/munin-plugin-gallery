The `stable-2.0` branch of the [Munin repository](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin) is
the source of Munin's stable releases.

* browse the branch: https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin/tree/stable-2.0
* clone the repository: `git clone --branch stable-2.0 https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin.git`

Breaking changes of the behaviour of plugins should be avoided in this branch.

Please note, that the `stable-2.0` branch is periodically merged into the `master` branch.
Thus your contributions to `stable-2.0` will eventually land in the upcoming
[Munin 3.x](/repositories/munin-master).
