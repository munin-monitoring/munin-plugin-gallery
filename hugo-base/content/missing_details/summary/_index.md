## Plugins without Summary

The plugin summary should be a brief description of the plugin's purpose.

The summary is parsed from the perlpod documentation header of a plugin.

The following example shows the recommended format:

```pod
=head1 NAME

foo_bar_ - monitor the rising amount of foo in bar
```

The following plugins seem to lack a summary.
Or maybe the generator code for this plugin gallery just did not parse the summary.
