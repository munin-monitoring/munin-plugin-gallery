## Plugins without Example Graphs

Example graphs are helpful for users looking for a suitable munin plugin.

The following plugins lack such example graphs.

You can easily add example graphs for a plugin with a few steps:

1. Create a subdirectory named `example-graphs` next to the plugin file.
2. The name of the image file should begin with the name of your plugins script file followed by `-day.png` for a daily graph, `-week.png` for a weekly graph, `-month.png` for a monthly graph, `-year.png` for a yearly graph, e.g. `cpu-day.png` or `smart_-month.png`.
3. Additional graphs can be suffixed with a number, e.g. `cpu-1.png`.
