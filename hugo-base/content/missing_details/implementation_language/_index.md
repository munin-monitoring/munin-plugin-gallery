## Plugins with unknown Implementation Language

Most plugins are implemented in an
[interpreted programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language)
(e.g. Perl, Shell, Python and Ruby).
Only a few plugins are implemented in a
[compiled programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language)
(e.g. C or Java).

The generator code for this plugin gallery failed to determine the programming language of the
following plugins.
