## Plugins without Graph Categories

Graph categories are used for visually grouping the plugins in the Munin master web interface.

Plugin authors are encouraged to pick graph categories from the recommended list of
[well-known graph categories](http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/reference/graph-category.html#well-known-categories).

The following plugins seem to lack a graph category.
Or maybe the generator code for this plugin gallery just did not parse the category string.

You are encouraged to improve this by reporting an issue or fixing the issue on your own.
Please take a look at [how to contribute](/contribute/) for details.
