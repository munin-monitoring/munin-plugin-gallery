## Improve the plugin gallery

The plugin gallery is generated by a small python script combined with a base template for
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (a static site generator) and the hugo theme
[ace-documentation](https://github.com/vantagedesign/ace-documentation/).

The [munin-plugin-gallery repository](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery)
contains all relevant files.

See the [README](https://github.com/munin-monitoring/munin-plugin-gallery/blob/master/README.md)
for hints and details.

Suggestions for other sources of plugins (not maintained by the
[Munin team on github](https://github.com/munin-monitoring)) are also welcome.
