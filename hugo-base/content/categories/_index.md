Each graph of a plugin can be assigned to a category.
It is used for grouping the graphs in the web-based visualization.

To get a clear and user-friendly overview in the plugin gallery (and on Munin WebGUI), we work on reducing the number of categories. Have a look at our list of [well-known-categories](http://guide.munin-monitoring.org/en/latest/reference/graph-category.html?highlight=gallery#well-known-categories), and choose an appropriate category to present your plugin in the gallery.

Users can always change the category to adapt their personal view by changing the plugins sourcecode before distributing it on their servers or by configuration setting on the Munin masters side (`munin.conf`).
