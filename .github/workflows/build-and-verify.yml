      # The gallery requires at least hugo 0.73 due to changes regarding taxonomies and terms.
      # This means at least Debian Buster or Ubuntu Hirsute (21.04) is required.
      # But sadly this is a bit complicated:
      # - Debian Bullseye: Debian is not supported by github actions (at least not in 2022)
      # - Ubuntu Hirsute: works, but it was removed from the Ubuntu mirrors in January 2022
      # - Ubuntu Impish: the hugo package requires a newer libc version (compared to Ubuntu Focal)
      # The solution is a bit dirty: use Ubuntu Focal as the base image and install the hugo
      # package from Debian Bullseye (shipping the same version of libc).
